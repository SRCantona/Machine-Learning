# Machine-Learning
The goal of this project is to develop a cutting-edge machine learning model capable of predicting gold prices with greater accuracy than traditional analytical methods by harnessing the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and data science. By analyzing vast datasets, including historical gold prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock indices, and economic indicators, the model aims to provide unparalleled insights into future price movements. 
Existing approaches often struggle to capture the intricate and volatile nature of global markets, influenced by unpredictable factors such as geopolitical events, economic policies, and sudden market shifts. To address these challenges, our model will leverage dynamic, adaptable machine learning algorithms that continuously evolve with changing economic conditions. A combination of time-series forecasting, deep learning networks, and ensemble methods will enhance prediction accuracy and reliability. Recognizing the limitations of current models, which often fail to integrate real-time data or respond swiftly to market fluctuations, this initiative will focus on creating a scalable and responsive forecasting tool. The successful implementation of this project is expected to improve gold price forecasts, empowering investors, policymakers, and analysts to make better-informed decisions. 
Ultimately, this effort aspires to set a new benchmark for commodity price prediction, fostering stability in financial markets and driving innovation in economic forecasting.






The performance metrics comparison between Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression algorithms utilized daily gold price data from 2013 to 2023. Key metrics for evaluation included RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and R-squared (RÂ²).
Linear Regression achieved an RMSE of 15.03, an MSE of 3.88, and an R-squared value of 0.9998. In comparison, Random Forest Regression recorded an RMSE of 26.15, an MSE of 5.11, and an R-squared value of 0.9996.
These results suggest that while both algorithms show high R-squared values, indicating strong explanatory power for the variance in gold prices, Linear Regression outperformed Random Forest Regression in terms of RMSE and MSE, indicating higher prediction accuracy for this dataset.
